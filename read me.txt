This contains the common datastructures which are used in problem solving. 

I have mostly reproduces the same logic given by -- Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.  while doing the coursera course 

and as given on the princeton.edu website. 

These datastructures are just for learning purposes and for academic purposes only.

I give credit to Prof . Robert Sedgewick and Prof. Kevin Wayne for making me understand these data structure implementations


Thanks
